## Projekt Vestana - Dress Rental Service

The main goal of this project is to create an app for 
managing dress rental service. This will include Spring
Boot application and website presentation.

## Git project guidelines
- never commit into the main branch
- create branches for one or multiple tasks (if their purpose is somewhat similar)
- commit messages are compulsory and must start with the task number, 
  e.i. 01-user entities added
- try to make at least three commits per task
